## General Information
Background of this project is US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.

The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter into the market. Expectation is to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not. The company wants to know: Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and How well those variables describe the price of a house. 
Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.


train.csv dataset is given and have to follow below steps to get the model.
1.Data Understanding and Exploratory Data Analysis ( EDA ) 
2.Data Preperation Step 
3.Training the model 
4.Model Prediction and Evaluation
5.Redge and Lasso Regularization
6.Results and Conclusions


## Conclusions
The R2_score , RSS and MSE are better for lasso regression than Ridge , so Lasso Regression gives the better model.


## Technologies Used
pandas seaborn matplotlib statsmodels sci-kit learn numpy
